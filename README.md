# Post Planning Guru

This is a project to create a tool which will allow the automation of posts to LinkedIn. This project is built on AWS using Serverless.

Once the project is completed, there will be a fully hosted service which will allow you to start automating your LinkedIn post within minutes.

If you prefer to run on your own infrastructure, you can deploy this solution to your own AWS account.

This project was originally created for the [Serverless SaaS Build Series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmexTtcbIn_gpz9Sik3YmJ7sTEKe3NvxA).
